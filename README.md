# React-Notes

Q:- What is React?
=> React is the JavaScript library. Which is used for user-interface for web-app as well as mobile-app. It was developed by Meta. React follows the single page application approach which means reducing the unnecessary re-rendring and real time based updation. It updates the current page with new data from the web server instead of loading new pages. This allows the page content to update in real time based on user actions.



Q: Difference b/w library and framework.
=> A library is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionalities, while a framework is a comprehensive set of tools, libraries, and conventions that provides a foundation for building software applications. Libraries are designed to be reused by multiple applications, while frameworks provide a structure and guidelines for building applications.


Q: what is CDN?
=> A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of servers distributed across various locations worldwide. It works by caching the content of a website (like images, videos, scripts, and other static assets) on these servers, which are referred to as "edge servers" or "points of presence" (PoPs). When a user requests content from a website, the CDN serves the request from the nearest edge server, reducing latency and speeding up content delivery.


Q: What is ReactDOM ?
=>  ReactDOM is a package that provides the rendering functionality for React applications. It is used to render React components into the DOM (Document Object Model). ReactDOM provides methods like ReactDOM.render() to render a React component into a specific DOM element, and ReactDOM.hydrate() to render a server-rendered React component into the DOM while preserving its initial state.
