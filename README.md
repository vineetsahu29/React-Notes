# React-Notes

Q:- What is React?
=> React is the JavaScript library. Which is used for user-interface for web-app as well as mobile-app. It was developed by Meta. React follows the single page application approach which means reducing the unnecessary re-rendring and real time based updation. It updates the current page with new data from the web server instead of loading new pages. This allows the page content to update in real time based on user actions.
